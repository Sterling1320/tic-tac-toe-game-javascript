***further description is for myself, you can stop reading from here cos it may not make much sense to you***

functions use kara, logic ye tha ki basically pehle se winning possibilities ko array mai define kardiya and uske baad, some and every method use karke matching kari. Even though this project souned simple at first, the implementation was not. It was nice learning about the functions and how to nest them to bring it all together, i'll say im rather happy with the outcome.
But dont be complacent, try to add more functionalities to this like-
1. Vs computer
3. maybe try to add custom symbols
4. animations
5. Sound and transitions
6. more game modes like 4x4 and 5x5
7. customizable themes
